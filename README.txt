FIRST COMMIT
-----------------------------
All classes have been created along with the necessary methods.
Extensive work conducted on the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class along with work on the 
'placeAllShipsRandomly' in the Ocean.java class

Next steps
further checks must be carried out in the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method to ensure the area to the port and starboard sides of the ship is free


SECOND COMMIT (08/02/2015)
—————————————————————————————
PORT and STARBOARD checks have been implemented in the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class

Next steps
further testing on the PORT and STARBOARD checks needs to take place along with reducing the size of the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class



THIRD COMMIT (08/02/2015)
—————————————————————————————
The ‘shootAt’ method in the ‘Ocean’ class has been completed and the ‘placeShipAt’ method in the ‘Ship’ class has been complete

Next Steps
Both methods implemented in this commit need further test to ensure functionality. ‘okToPlaceShipAt’ method has to be expanded to check for the grid locations that are diagonal to the ship
