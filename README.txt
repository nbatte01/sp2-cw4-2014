FIRST COMMIT
-----------------------------
All classes have been created along with the necessary methods.
Extensive work conducted on the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class along with work on the 
'placeAllShipsRandomly' in the Ocean.java class

Next steps
further checks must be carried out in the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method to ensure the area to the port and starboard sides of the ship is free


SECOND COMMIT (08/02/2015)
—————————————————————————————
PORT and STARBOARD checks have been implemented in the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class

Next steps
further testing on the PORT and STARBOARD checks needs to take place along with reducing the size of the 'okToPlaceShipAt' method in the Ship class



THIRD COMMIT (08/02/2015)
—————————————————————————————
The ‘shootAt’ method in the ‘Ocean’ class has been completed and the ‘placeShipAt’ method in the ‘Ship’ class has been complete

Next Steps
Both methods implemented in this commit need further test to ensure functionality. ‘okToPlaceShipAt’ method has to be expanded to check for the grid locations that are diagonal to the ship


FOURTH COMMIT (12/02/2015)
—————————————————————————————
A temp method titled ‘okToPlaceShipAt2’ has been created to compress the original ‘okToPlaceShipAt’ method without deleting the working version 

Next Steps 
further compression of the ‘okToPlaceShipAt2’method


FIFTH COMMIT (LATE 12/02/2015)
——————————————————————————————
‘okToPlaceShipAt2’ has been compressed and ‘okToPlaceShipAt’ has been deleted. the name of ‘okToPlaceShipAt2’ has then been changed back to ‘okToPlaceShipAt’ to meet assignment specification standards

Next Steps
Complete the ‘shootAt’ method in the Ship class


SIXTH COMMIT (16/02/2015)
———————————————————————————————
The ‘shootAt’ methods in the ‘Ship’ and ‘Ocean’ classes have been completed along with the ‘print’ method in the ‘Ocean’ class. The ‘EmptySea’ class has been given a hit array like all the other boat so that the correct character can be printed by the ‘print’ method. The logic behind the game is functioning correctly however further testing must be completed

Next Steps 
Finalise the UI of the game in the ‘BattleshipGame’ class and tidy all methods for excess code that was used only during development. 

SEVENTH COMMIT (02/03/2015)
————————————————————————————————
All classes have been refined and the entire game is now complete. It must be noted that the individual subclasses of ships still have different letters which all need to be changed to ‘.’ before submission of assignment
